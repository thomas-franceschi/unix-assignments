Bake: you defined all the right variables, you have code to exit
early if the command doesnt work, and you conditionally echo 
command based on verbose.. the issue is that it is not correct
shell scripting. I included the solution so you can take a look
at how for's should be defined and how variables should be referenced
and whatnot. It seemed like you had the right ideas, just bad execution.
Good work otherwise.
