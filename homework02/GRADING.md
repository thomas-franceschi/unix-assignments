Homework 02 - Grading
=====================

**Score**: 13 / 15

Deductions
----------
**Activity 1**

- **\#1.** -0.25 **--** Did you mean to use *ln* instead of *ls*?

- **\#2.** -0.50 **--** This is actually not surprising because the hard links just store references to existing inodes and dont copy the contents of the file.

- **\#3.** -1.0 **--** Are you sure that you copied the files over correctly? This is drastically less than even just your original 10M file you created.

- **\#4.** -0.25 **--** What are the contents of *command.txt* that you use for *sftp*?
